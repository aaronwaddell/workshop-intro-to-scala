# IntelliJ IDEA Setup
The nice thing here is that even the community version of IntelliJ IDEA
supports the Scala plugin! Here's what you do:

1) Grab IntelliJ if you don't already have it: 
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/
2) Spin up IntelliJ and go to Preferences -> Plugins then click
"Install JetBrains plugin..."
3) Search for "Scala"
4) Found it? Install and restart IntelliJ
5) Open the project with File -> Open, **selecting the build.sbt file**
6) On the "Import project" window accept the defaults and import the project
7) Wait for a bit! IntelliJ's going to download project dependencies etc
8) Celebrate in a manner most favoured by you
